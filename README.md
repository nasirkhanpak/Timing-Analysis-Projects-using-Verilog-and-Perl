# Design Verification Using Verilog and Perl
A). Write Verilog code the following 4‐bit ripple carry adder.
B). Write a Perl program to automatically create the testing input data and testing output data which you can use in your Verilog testbench. Your Verilog testbench should compare the 4‐bit ripple carry adder outputs values with the output data created by Perl program.

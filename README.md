# Design Verification Using Verilog and Perl
A). Verilog code for 4‐bit ripple carry adder.
B). Perl program to automatically create the testing input data and testing output data which is used in Verilog testbench. Verilog testbench is comparing 4‐bit ripple carry adder output values with the output data created by Perl program.
